I am an environmental management student focusing on international energy access and wildlife conservation research. I am passionate about expanding electricity systems with renewable resources to communities across the globe, and I continue to work on wildlife conservation issues through my Bass Connections research team. I have a strong background in crisis communications and international affairs. I am excited to combine my quantitative skills to support just energy programs and conservation outcomes in my career.
